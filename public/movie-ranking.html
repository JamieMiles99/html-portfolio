<h1>The best movies according to Jamie</h1>
<h2>Three of my favourite ever films</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>The original and by far the best. It still has bags of style and asks interesting questions over 20 years on.</p>
<h3>Back to the Future</h3>
<p>Probably my most-watched film. The premise, the soundtrack, the characters... another timeless classic.</p>
<h3>Donnie Darko</h3>
<p>Another marriage of style and substance. An unexpected surprise when I first saw this in the cinema.</p>
